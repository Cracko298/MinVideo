# Contributing
## Bugs, suggestions and questions
If you'd like to report a bug, suggest a feature or you just want to ask something, open an [issue](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/MinVideo/issues).

Bugs should be as detailed as possible. *Doesn't work*, *Buggy*, *Broken* is not a valid report. 

## Writing code
If you'd like to contribute to the project by directly writing code, [fork](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/MinVideo/fork) the repository and push your changes to the created repo on your account.
Consider using **Git** and avoid using the GitHub's upload file feature as it does not respect `.gitignore`.

After you're done, open a [pull request](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/MinVideo/pulls) and your code will be reviewed.

Please note that your code will be in the public domain as the [license](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/MinVideo/blob/master/LICENSE) states giving everyone full rights to use it in any way.

### Rules
- Do not modify the video format without previous discussion
- Keep it as simple as possible so it can be implemented without any libraries
- Code should be backwards compatible
- Do not include any cache, temporary or executable files in the source code. The `.gitignore` list should prevent that but only if you use **Git**.
